# Road-Accident-Analytics
This is a data analysis project to identify various reasons behind Road accidents and predict severity. [Mydata1](Mydata1.csv)

## Accident Severity
Visualised Data of accidents occuring depending on the type of vehicles involved (India's Dataset considered)

## Fault Based
Visualised accidents that occur due to various types of faults of humans and also due to weather conditions (India's Dataset considered)

## Time Based
Visualize the rush hour and conclude the time period when the accidents are more likely to occur (India's Dataset considered) [Mydata2](Mydata2.csv)

## Seveerity Prediction using MLP
Using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Algorithm to predict the severity of accidents and classifying them into separate classes based on severity using Random Forest. TO further optimise the results and improve accuracy of the trained model, we use Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD)  and obtain an approximate accuracy of 89% (US Dataset) [US Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
